# Budgetary Analysis - City of Seattle
## Scenario
The Office of the Inspector General for the City of Seattle has commissioned an investigatory audit of the City's budget and appropriations over the 2012 fiscal year. The goal of this audit is to show the total funds spent by each department. Naturally, you have selected Python for this project. 

## Tasks
- Aggregate (sum) how much money was spent by each department. Hint: you can use a dictionary to store a list of expenses for each department.
- Print the results to the screen as neatly as possible. For example, you can simply print the department, a white-space character (tab or space), then the sum of that department's expenses.
